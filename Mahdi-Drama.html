 <p> n film and television, drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone.
     [1] The drama of this kind is<mark> usually qualified with additional terms</mark> that specify its particular super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre,
     [2] such as soap opera, police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama,
      and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject matter,
       or they combine a drama's otherwise serious tone with elements that encourage a broader range of moods.
        To these ends, a primary element in a drama is the occurrence of conflict—emotional, social,
         or otherwise—and its resolution in the course of the storyline.
         <br>
     All forms of cinema or television that involve fictional stories are forms of drama in the broader sense if their storytelling is achieved
      by means of actors who represent (mimesis) characters. In this broader sense, drama is a mode distinct from novels, short stories,
       and narrative poetry or songs.[3] In the modern era, before the birth of cinema or television, "drama" within theatre was a type of play that
        was neither a comedy nor a tragedy. It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted.
         "Radio drama" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance,
          it has also been used to describe the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.</p>
